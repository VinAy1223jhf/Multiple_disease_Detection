**🧠 Project Highlights:**
1. Advanced Machine Learning Models:
Utilized algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Classifier to build robust detection models.
Trained the models using extensive datasets, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
2. Cutting-Edge Libraries and Tools:
Implemented the models using popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), and Numpy.
Employed data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to optimize performance.
3. User-Friendly Interface with Streamlit:
Developed the backend server and user interface using Streamlit, making the application intuitive and accessible.
Streamlit’s interactive widgets and real-time updates enhance the user experience, allowing for easy input and immediate results.
🌟 Key Features:
Diabetes Detection: Analyzes key health indicators like glucose levels, blood pressure, and insulin levels to predict the risk of diabetes.
Heart Disease Detection: Evaluates factors such as cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and age to assess heart disease risk.
Parkinson's Disease Detection: Uses vocal and motor function data to identify early signs of Parkinson's disease.
🚀 Technical Stack:
Backend: Python, Flask
Frontend: Streamlit
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
Deployment: Streamlit sharing platform
**🔍 How It Works:**
Data Input: Users enter relevant health data through an easy-to-use form.
